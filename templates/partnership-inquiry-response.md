**Subject:** Re: Partnership Offer - Solana Tamagotchi

Hi Keleyan,

Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Solana Tamagotchi! 🎮

I appreciate you taking the time to contact us. Before we proceed with any partnership discussions, I'd like to learn more about:

1. **Crypto Infinity Community** - Could you share more details about your community? (Size, engagement metrics, demographics, etc.)

2. **Partnership Proposal** - What specific partnership model are you proposing? (Marketing, community growth, investment, technical collaboration?)

3. **Proof of Work** - You mentioned "working proofs" - could you share:
   - Case studies of previous partnerships
   - Metrics/results from similar projects
   - References from other project founders

4. **Investment Details** - What kind of investment structure are you offering? (Terms, amounts, requirements)

5. **Mutual Benefits** - How would this partnership benefit both parties?

I'm always open to legitimate partnerships that can help grow the Solana Tamagotchi ecosystem, but I need to ensure any collaboration aligns with our project's values and goals.

Please feel free to share more details, and we can schedule a call if the proposal looks promising.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Solana Tamagotchi Team
