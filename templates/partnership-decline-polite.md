# Вежливый отказ от платного партнерства

## Вариант 1: Профессиональный отказ (рекомендую)

Hi Keleyan,

Thank you for the detailed partnership proposal! I appreciate you taking the time to explain what Crypto Infinity Community can offer.

At this moment, we're not in a position to pay upfront for marketing services. As a growing project, we're focusing on organic growth and building our community through product development and user engagement.

However, I'm definitely interested in exploring alternative partnership models:

**Possible Future Collaboration:**
- **Revenue Share Model**: If you can drive measurable results (users, transactions, volume), we could discuss a revenue-sharing arrangement
- **Mutual Promotion**: Cross-promotion where we both promote each other's communities without upfront costs
- **Delayed Partnership**: Once we have more traction and budget, we'd love to revisit this opportunity

**What I'd Need to Consider:**
- Proof of ROI from similar projects
- Specific metrics (community size, engagement rates, conversion rates)
- Case studies showing actual results

I hope you understand our position. If you're open to alternative partnership structures, I'd be happy to discuss further!

## Вариант 2: Более прямой (если хочешь быть короче)

Hi Keleyan,

Thanks for the proposal! Unfortunately, we're not ready to pay upfront for marketing services at this stage.

We're focusing on organic growth and product development. However, I'm open to discussing:
- Revenue-share models (pay based on results)
- Mutual cross-promotion (no upfront costs)
- Future collaboration when we have more budget

If you're interested in alternative partnership structures, let me know!

Best,

## Вариант 3: Очень вежливый, но четкий отказ

Hi Keleyan,

Thank you for reaching out with your partnership proposal. I appreciate the detailed breakdown of what Crypto Infinity Community can offer.

After careful consideration, we've decided that we're not ready to invest in paid marketing partnerships at this time. As a growing project, we're currently focusing our resources on product development and organic community growth.

I'd be happy to keep your contact information for future opportunities. Once we're in a better position to invest in marketing partnerships, I'll definitely reach out.

I wish you and Crypto Infinity Community all the best!

Best regards,
