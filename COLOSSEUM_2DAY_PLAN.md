## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Presentation
- **Keep it visual**: More images, fewer words
- **Tell a story**: Problem → Solution → Traction → Vision
- **Show, don't tell**: Screenshots > descriptions
- **Highlight uniqueness**: "ONLY Tamagotchi on Solana"

### For Video
- **First 10 seconds matter most**: Hook them fast
- **Show working product**: Not mockups, actual gameplay
- **Be enthusiastic**: Your passion is contagious
- **End with CTA**: "Try it now at solanatamagotchi.com!"

### For Submission Form
- **Be specific**: Numbers > vague claims
- **Prove traction**: "70+ NFTs" not "many users"
- **Emphasize Solana**: We're Solana-first, not multi-chain
- **Show vision**: Where we're going (100K users, DEX, mobile)
