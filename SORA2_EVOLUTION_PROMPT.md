# 🎬 SORA 2 Video Prompt: Эволюция от обезьяны к человеку

## 📝 Основной промпт:

```
A cinematic time-lapse evolution sequence showing the transformation from ape to modern human. The scene opens in a lush prehistoric jungle with dappled sunlight filtering through ancient trees. A primitive ape-like creature (Australopithecus) is shown walking on all fours, then gradually standing upright on two legs, demonstrating the first steps of bipedalism.

The camera follows the evolutionary journey through time, with smooth morphing transitions between different hominid stages. The creature's posture becomes more upright, the brow ridge recedes, the cranium expands, and the body proportions shift. Each evolutionary stage is marked by subtle environmental changes - from dense jungle to savanna grasslands, from primitive tools to more sophisticated stone implements.

The sequence progresses through key evolutionary milestones: Australopithecus walking upright, Homo habilis using simple tools, Homo erectus with controlled fire, Neanderthal with advanced hunting techniques, and finally modern Homo sapiens with refined features, larger brain capacity, and sophisticated tool use.

The final scene shows a modern human standing confidently, looking forward with intelligence and awareness, surrounded by symbols of human achievement - fire, tools, art, and civilization. The transformation is smooth, organic, and scientifically accurate, showing the gradual changes in skull shape, body proportions, and posture.

Visual style: Cinematic, documentary-quality, realistic human and primate anatomy, natural lighting transitions, time-lapse effect with smooth morphing, educational and awe-inspiring. Color palette evolves from warm jungle greens to golden savanna tones to modern neutral colors. The evolution feels continuous and natural, not jarring or abrupt.

Duration: 30-45 seconds. Aspect ratio: 16:9. Style: Realistic, cinematic, educational documentary, smooth transitions, time-lapse evolution.

## 🎨 Альтернативный вариант (более детальный):

```
An epic evolutionary journey from ape to human, presented as a continuous morphing sequence.

SCENE 1 (0-8s): Ancient jungle environment, 4 million years ago. An Australopithecus afarensis walks on all fours, then slowly rises to stand on two legs. The creature has a small brain, prominent brow ridge, and ape-like features. It walks bipedally but with a stooped posture. The environment shows dense tropical forest.

SCENE 2 (8-16s): Transition to savanna grasslands, 2 million years ago. The creature morphs into Homo habilis - more upright posture, slightly larger brain, beginning to use simple stone tools. The hands become more dexterous, showing opposable thumbs. The creature is seen picking up and examining a primitive stone tool.

SCENE 3 (16-24s): Homo erectus stage, 1.5 million years ago. The body becomes more human-like - taller, more slender build, larger brain case. The creature is shown controlling fire for the first time, with flames illuminating the face. The brow ridge is still prominent but less pronounced. The environment shows open grasslands with scattered trees.

SCENE 4 (24-32s): Neanderthal stage, 200,000 years ago. Robust build, large nose, prominent brow ridge, but clearly more human-like. The creature is shown hunting with sophisticated spears, working together in groups. The brain size is similar to modern humans. The environment shows Ice Age landscapes with snow and ice.

SCENE 5 (32-45s): Modern Homo sapiens, present day. The final transformation shows a modern human with refined features - high forehead, small brow ridge, prominent chin, larger brain case, graceful posture. The human is shown standing confidently, looking forward with intelligence and awareness. The environment transitions to modern civilization - subtle hints of buildings, technology, and human achievement in the background.

Technical details: Smooth morphing between stages, realistic anatomy based on scientific evidence, natural lighting that evolves with time periods, continuous camera movement following the subject, time-lapse effect showing millions of years of evolution compressed into seconds. The transformation should feel organic and gradual, not like separate creatures but one continuous evolutionary line.

Visual style: Documentary quality, National Geographic aesthetic, realistic human and primate anatomy, cinematic composition, educational and inspiring. Color grading evolves from warm jungle tones to cool Ice Age blues to modern neutral colors.

## 🚀 Короткий вариант (для быстрых тестов):

```
Time-lapse evolution from ape to human: A primitive ape-like creature in jungle gradually stands upright, morphing through evolutionary stages (Australopithecus → Homo habilis → Homo erectus → Neanderthal → Modern human). Each stage shows anatomical changes: upright posture, expanding brain, receding brow ridge, refined features. Environment transitions from jungle to savanna to Ice Age to modern. Smooth morphing, cinematic, documentary style, realistic anatomy, 30-45 seconds, 16:9.

## 🎯 Вариант с акцентом на ключевые изменения:

```
A scientific evolution sequence showing the transformation from ape ancestor to modern human, focusing on key anatomical changes.

The sequence begins with a chimpanzee-like ancestor walking on all fours in a dense forest. As the creature evolves, key changes are highlighted:
- Posture: Gradual shift from quadrupedal to fully bipedal walking
- Skull: Brain case expands, brow ridge recedes, face becomes flatter
- Body: Proportions change - legs become longer relative to arms, pelvis narrows
- Hands: Thumbs become more opposable, fine motor skills develop
- Tools: Progression from no tools to simple stones to sophisticated implements

The final human stands tall and confident, with modern proportions and intelligence visible in the eyes. The transformation is smooth and continuous, showing millions of years compressed into a seamless morphing sequence.

Style: Scientific accuracy, documentary realism, smooth transitions, educational focus. Duration: 30-45 seconds.

## 💡 Вариант с акцентом на интеллект и сознание:

```
An evolutionary journey from ape to human, emphasizing the development of intelligence and consciousness. The sequence shows not just physical changes, but the awakening of human awareness.

The ape ancestor moves instinctively, then gradually the eyes show more awareness, curiosity, and intelligence. As the creature evolves, it begins to observe, learn, create tools, control fire, and finally - shows self-awareness and forward-thinking.

The final human stands with a gaze that reflects consciousness, intelligence, and the ability to shape the world. The transformation emphasizes the development of the mind as much as the body.

Cinematic, philosophical, awe-inspiring. 30-45 seconds, 16:9, realistic anatomy.
